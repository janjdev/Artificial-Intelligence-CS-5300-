# Project
Detecting Network Intrusions

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is two-fold and will thus have two separate implementations.
#### Goal 1
Using the KDD Cup 1999 data source, create and train a model to separate and detect normal network traffic from anomalies (attacks/intrusions)

#### Goal 2
Using the same data source, employing data mining to create a three-fold model comprised of support vector machines (SVM) decision trees, and Naive Bayes techniques to decrease false positive results when determining network attacks. I will attempt to follow ad recreate the work of Kathleen Goeschel, found in her published work, [*REDUCING FALSE POSITIVES IN INTRUSION
DETECTION SYSTEMS USING DATA-MINING TECHNIQUES UTILIZING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, DECISION TREES, AND NAIVE BAYES FOR OFF-LINE ANALYSIS*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7506774)
